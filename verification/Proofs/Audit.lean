   Proofs/Audit.lean — statement + specification binding (P1-a).

   WHAT THIS ADDS over check.sh Phases 2b/3/3b. Those establish that each
   certificate is a theorem and rests on exactly the declared axioms. None
   of them establishes WHAT THE THEOREM SAYS. A certificate gutted to a
   tautology keeps its name, its kind, and its axiom cone, and passes every
   one of them. Worse, the reference definitions the statements are stated
   AGAINST can be redefined to be the extracted code itself, at which point
   the certificate says `loop = loop` and every cone is unchanged.

   So this file emits a canonical AUDIT-MANIFEST block covering:
     · the POLICY constants (both cone tiers, and the module prefix that
       defines what counts as a specification);
     · every certificate's fully-elaborated STATEMENT (`pp.all`);
     · every specification constant transitively reachable from those
       statements, with its fully-elaborated DEFINITION BODY. A Prop-valued
       constant contributes its statement rather than its proof term, by
       proof irrelevance — the proof term is not what fidelity lives in.

   check.sh binds the SHA-256 of that block, and the block itself is
   committed, so a mismatch can be DIFFED against a reference rather than
   merely reported.

   TWO TIERS, NOT ONE. This repository has an arithmetic tier that must
   stay oracle-free and an apex tier that legitimately carries this fork's
   hash and wire-format axioms. The boundary differs BETWEEN FORKS. A
   single global allowed-axiom list would silently widen the arithmetic
   tier to accept hash oracles, which is the most valuable property these
   repositories have. Hence a per-certificate expected cone below.

   NO HAND-KEPT STATEMENT FINGERPRINTS. The companion SLH-DSA auditor pins
   a 32-bit `Expr.hash` per certificate as a diagnostic. That table is one
   more thing that can fall out of sync, and the canonical block already
   covers every statement at full fidelity — a diff of the block says more
   than a changed integer does. Membership is derived, not listed.

   STANDING LIMIT: an audit executed by a harness cannot defend against an
   author who edits that harness. The consumer defence is, and remains, the
   pinned commit reviewed at the pin.
