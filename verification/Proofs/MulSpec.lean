   Proofs/MulSpec.lean — total correctness of field MULTIPLICATION

   WHAT THIS FILE PROVES (one big theorem, `mul_spec`)

     ASCII:  forall a b : Fe,  Bnd(a, 2^54) and Bnd(b, 2^54)  ==>
             fe_mul a b = ok r   with   Bnd(r, 2^51 + 2^13)
             and  [[r]] = [[a]] * [[b]]   in F_p,  p = 2^255 - 19
     LaTeX:  $\forall a\,b,\ \mathrm{Bnd}(a,2^{54})\wedge\mathrm{Bnd}(b,2^{54})
             \Rightarrow \exists r,\ \mathrm{fe\_mul}\,a\,b = \mathrm{ok}\,r \wedge
             \llbracket r\rrbracket=\llbracket a\rrbracket\cdot\llbracket b\rrbracket$

   Here `Bnd x c` = "all 5 limbs of x are < c" and [[x]] = ⟪x⟫ =
   (x0 + x1·2^51 + x2·2^102 + x3·2^153 + x4·2^204) mod p — both defined in
   Proofs/Denote.lean. "fe_mul a b = ok r" (written `fe_mul a b ⦃ post ⦄`)
   means TOTAL correctness: the Rust code never panics/overflows on such
   inputs, *including* its ten `debug_assert!`s, which Charon keeps as
   `massert` obligations that we must PROVE (they are theorems, not
   assumptions).

   RUST ANALOG
   `impl Mul<&'a FieldElement51> for &FieldElement51 { fn mul }`,
   curve25519/solana-ed25519/src/backend/serial/u64/field.rs:115-213, with its
   nested helper `m` (widening 64×64→128 multiply, field.rs:119), the local
   constant `LOW_51_BIT_MASK = (1u64 << 51) - 1` (field.rs:172) and the ten
   `debug_assert!(limb < 1 << 54)` checks (field.rs:162-166). The mechanical
   Lean model of that code is the generated function
   `SharedAFieldElement51.Insts.CoreOpsArithMulSharedBFieldElement51FieldElement51.mul`
   in gen/CurveField/Funs.lean, aliased `fe_mul` in Proofs/Denote.lean.

   THE ALGORITHM BEING VERIFIED (radix-2^51 schoolbook multiply, 19-folded)
   Writing A = Sum_i x_i 2^(51 i) and B = Sum_j y_j 2^(51 j), the full product
   is Sum_{i,j} x_i y_j 2^(51(i+j)) — ten powers 2^0 .. 2^(51·8). Because
   2^255 = p + 19, i.e. 2^255 ≡ 19 (mod p), every high term with i+j ≥ 5 is
   folded down: x_i y_j 2^(51(i+j)) ≡ 19 · x_i y_j 2^(51(i+j-5)). The code
   therefore precomputes b1_19 = 19·y1, …, b4_19 = 19·y4 (u64; fits since
   19·2^54 < 2^64) and accumulates five u128 columns (field.rs:144-148):

     c0 = x0·y0 + 19·(x4·y1 + x3·y2 + x2·y3 + x1·y4)
     c1 = x1·y0 + x0·y1 + 19·(x4·y2 + x3·y3 + x2·y4)
     c2 = x2·y0 + x1·y1 + x0·y2 + 19·(x4·y3 + x3·y4)
     c3 = x3·y0 + x2·y1 + x1·y2 + x0·y3 + 19·(x4·y4)
     c4 = x4·y0 + x3·y1 + x2·y2 + x1·y3 + x0·y4

   With limbs < 2^54 each column is < (1+i + 19·(4-i))·2^108 ≤ 77·2^108 < 2^115,
   far below the u128 limit 2^128. Then a single carry pass (field.rs:175-188)
   normalizes: c_{k+1} += c_k >> 51, out[k] = c_k & mask; the final carry
   (multiples of 2^255) re-enters as out[0] += 19·carry (field.rs:205), and one
   mini-carry out[1] += out[0] >> 51; out[0] &= mask (field.rs:208-209) leaves
   all limbs < 2^51 + 2^13.

   PROOF ARCHITECTURE — a fully NAMED machine-checked symbolic execution
   The generated body is a chain of ~95 fallible machine operations in the
   `Result` monad. The script mirrors it step by step:

     let* ⟨ x, x_post ⟩ ← spec_lemma by tac

   is the Aeneas "progress" step: it consumes the next monadic operation,
   applies the registered spec lemma for it (`m_spec`, `U128.add_spec`,
   `Array.index_usize_spec`, …), names the result `x` and its postcondition
   `x_post`, and discharges the lemma's precondition — i.e. the u64/u128
   overflow side condition of that very operation — with the `by tac` block.
   After each step an explicit bound fact `hv_… : ….val < n·2^108` (or an
   identification `he_… : i = x3` of which limb a read returned) is recorded,
   so that every later side condition is LINEAR arithmetic over already-named
   quantities and `omega`/`scalar_tac` close it without nonlinear reasoning.

   The final assembly has three layers:
     (1) hkey  — exact ℕ carry accounting:
                 feVal r + p·carry = c0 + 2^51·c1 + 2^102·c2 + 2^153·c3 + 2^204·c4
                 (pure div/mod bookkeeping of the carry pass; `omega`).
     (2) hnc0–hnc4 — each column c_k as a polynomial in the input limbs
                 (substitute all step postconditions, then `ring`).
     (3) hAB   — the F_p identity A·B = Sum_k c_k·2^(51 k), via
                 `linear_combination D * h255` where h255 : (2:F_p)^255 = 19
                 and D is the explicit wrap-around polynomial
                   D =        (x1·y4 + x2·y3 + x3·y2 + x4·y1)
                     + 2^51 ·(x2·y4 + x3·y3 + x4·y2)
                     + 2^102·(x3·y4 + x4·y3)
                     + 2^153·(x4·y4)
                     = Sum_{i+j ≥ 5} x_i·y_j·2^(51(i+j-5)),
                 because over ℤ:  A·B = Sum_k c_k·2^(51 k) + (2^255 - 19)·D.
   Casting (1) into F_p kills the p·carry term ((p : F_p) = 0) and chaining it
   with (3) yields ⟪r⟫ = ⟪a⟫·⟪b⟫.

   ROLE IN THE MAIN THEOREM (Proofs/FieldMain.lean)
   `mul_spec` is the multiplicative half of `fieldImplementation`: the
   corollaries impl_mul_comm/assoc, impl_one_mul, impl_mul_inv_cancel and
   impl_left_distrib all run `fe_mul` and rest on this theorem.
   Imports: Proofs/SubNegSpec (transitively Denote/ReduceSpec: ⟪·⟫, Bnd,
   two_pow_255_eq) and mathlib's `linear_combination` tactic.
   Dependents: Proofs/SquareSpec.lean (same architecture, reuses the `dis`
   macro), Proofs/InvertSpec.lean (mul steps of the pow22501 chain),
   Proofs/Field.lean and Proofs/FieldMain.lean.

   PROVENANCE: the script was generated by /tmp/gen_mul_proof.py to mirror the
   generated body, then hand-tuned.

    `x mod 2^51` — the "keep the low limb" half of every carry step.
