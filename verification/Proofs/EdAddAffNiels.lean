   Proofs/EdAddAffNiels.lean — coordinate-level specs for the MIXED addition
   kernels  EdwardsPoint ± AffineNielsPoint -> CompletedPoint  and for the
   negation of an AffineNielsPoint.

   CONTEXT.  The Rust crate curve25519/solana-ed25519 adds an extended point
   P = (X₁:Y₁:Z₁:T₁) and a PRECOMPUTED affine cache N = (y+x, y−x, 2dxy)
   (an `AffineNielsPoint`, implicit Z = 1 — see Proofs/EdDenote.lean) with
   the Hisil–Wong–Carter–Dawson mixed formulas
   (src/backend/serial/curve_models.rs:458-472 for `add`, 479-493 for `sub`):

       PP    = (Y₁+X₁)·(y+x)          MM = (Y₁−X₁)·(y−x)
       Txy2d = T₁·(2dxy)              Z2 = Z₁+Z₁
       add:  (X, Y, Z, T) = (PP−MM, PP+MM, Z2+Txy2d, Z2−Txy2d)
       sub:  mirrored — multiply CROSSWISE (PM = (Y₁+X₁)(y−x),
             MP = (Y₁−X₁)(y+x)) and FLIP the sign of Txy2d in Z/T:
             (X, Y, Z, T) = (PM−MP, PM+MP, Z2−Txy2d, Z2+Txy2d)

   (3 muls, 3 unreduced adds, 3 reduced subs each — one mul fewer than the
   projective-Niels kernels because the affine cache has no Z field).
   `neg` (curve_models.rs:516-522) negates the cached point by SWAPPING the
   y+x / y−x fields and negating 2dxy:  −(x, y) = (−x, y), so
   y+(−x) = y−x, y−(−x) = y+x, 2d(−x)y = −2dxy.

   THIS FILE proves, in the STATEMENT POLICY of the point-spec phase
   (coordinate level ONLY — no curve constants, no division, no OnCurve;
   the algebra-law packaging happens in a later file):

     * `add_affniels_spec` / `sub_affniels_spec` — under `ExtValid Pt` and
       `AffNielsValid N` (the limb-bound + Z ≠ 0 validity predicates of
       Proofs/EdDenote.lean) the kernels run PANIC-FREE, every output field
       carries the exact bound its producing field op guarantees
       (sub: 2⁵², single unreduced add of two reduced/mul outputs: 2⁵³,
       unreduced add consuming another unreduced add: 2⁵⁴), and the four
       coordinates satisfy the formulas above, stated STRICTLY in terms of
       the input struct-field denotations ⟪Pt.X⟫ … ⟪N.xy2d⟫;
     * `affniels_neg_spec` — negation runs, preserves `AffNielsValid`, and
       denotes the field swap + negation.

   BOUND BOOKKEEPING (the entire panic-freedom argument).  Inputs carry
   Bnd 2⁵² (ExtValid) resp. Bnd 2⁵³/2⁵² (AffNielsValid); the field ops
   require Bnd 2⁵⁴ (mul/sub, MulSpec/SubNegSpec) resp. pairwise limb sums
   < 2⁶⁴ (the unreduced add, AddSpec).  Chasing the chain:

       Y₁+X₁, Z2 : add of two 2⁵² values            -> 2⁵³   (< 2⁵⁴ ✓)
       Y₁−X₁     : sub                              -> 2⁵²
       PP/MM/PM/MP/Txy2d : mul of ≤ 2⁵³/2⁵³ inputs  -> 2⁵¹+2¹³
       X-output  : sub of two mul outputs           -> 2⁵²
       Y-output  : add of two mul outputs           -> 2⁵³
       Z2 ± Txy2d: sub -> 2⁵²;  add of 2⁵³ + (2⁵¹+2¹³) values -> 2⁵⁴

   so every intermediate is a legal input for its consumer, and the output
   bounds exposed below (X: 2⁵², Y: 2⁵³, then add: Z 2⁵⁴ / T 2⁵²,
   sub: Z 2⁵² / T 2⁵⁴) are the TRUE per-field bounds of the chain.

   PROOF TECHNIQUE: the InvertSpec playbook — unfold the transpiled body,
   walk it with `let* ⟨x, posts…⟩ ← spec by edis` (one field op per line;
   `edis` discharges each op's Bnd side condition by hypothesis weakening;
   where the needed bound is verbatim in context the `let*` machinery
   discharges it itself and no `by` block is given).  The final `let*`
   also reduces the trailing `ok {…}` and collapses the constructor
   projections, so the four coordinate equations close by rewriting the
   recorded postconditions (plus `ring` where 2·Z appears as Z+Z).
   The three `aff_*`-prefixed wrappers re-state AddSpec's `add_spec` (whose
   hypotheses name all 10 limbs, so the `let*` machinery cannot apply it
   directly) and SubNegSpec's `sub_spec`/`neg_spec` in hypothesis-light form,
   exactly like `mul_spec'` (InvertSpec.lean); prefixed `aff_` to avoid name
   collisions with the sibling point-op spec files, which declare their own.

   Nothing in gen/ is modified; we only run the transpiled code.

    Every field op consumed below needs its inputs bounded (mul/sub: 2⁵⁴,

    tighter bound (2⁵², 2⁵³ or 2⁵¹+2¹³); this side-condition tactic closes
    such goals either by `scalar_tac` or by weakening an existing `Bnd _ c`
    hypothesis with `Bnd.mono` and `c ≤ c'` by `norm_num`.  Passed as the
    discharger to every `let*` step.  (Local re-declaration of InvertSpec's

/-! ## Hypothesis-light wrappers for the unreduced add, sub and negate

    The base specs take the 5 limbs of every argument as explicit variables
    (their proofs compute limb by limb), so the `let*` machinery cannot
    apply them directly; each wrapper repackages the limbs existentially via
    `Fe.exists_limbs` — the `mul_spec'` pattern of Proofs/InvertSpec.lean.
    The unreduced `fe_add` needs TWO instances because its output bound is
    input-relative (`∀ c, Bnd a c → Bnd b c → Bnd r (2·c)`, AddSpec.lean):
    the kernels below add reduced values (2⁵² → 2⁵³) but also feed one add
    output into another add (2⁵³ → 2⁵⁴). -/

    (the single field negation goes through the operator wrapper
    `SharedAFieldElement51.Insts.CoreOpsArithNegFieldElement51.neg`,
    Funs.lean:1732, which is definitionally `FieldElement51::negate`).

    MATH:  AffNielsValid N  ==>  neg N = ok r  with  AffNielsValid r  and

        ⟪r.y_plus_x⟫  = ⟪N.y_minus_x⟫,
        ⟪r.y_minus_x⟫ = ⟪N.y_plus_x⟫,
        ⟪r.xy2d⟫      = −⟪N.xy2d⟫.

    On denotations this IS the cache of the negated affine point: if N
    caches (x, y) then r caches (−x, y), since y+(−x) = y−x, y−(−x) = y+x
    and 2d(−x)y = −(2dxy) — the algebra layer derives
    `IsAffNielsOf N x y → IsAffNielsOf r (−x) y` from these three equations
    by ring reasoning on the 121666-characterization of `IsAffNielsOf`.
    Validity is PRESERVED (not just some bound): the swapped fields keep
    their 2⁵³ bounds verbatim, and `negate` REDUCES, returning 2⁵² — so r
    can re-enter the add/sub kernels above.  (The y±x swap is pure data
    movement — the two equations hold by `rfl`; only xy2d runs code.)

    WHY NEEDED: signed-digit lookup tables (`NafLookupTable`/`select`)
    produce −N for negative digits with exactly this function. -/
