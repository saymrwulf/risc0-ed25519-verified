   Proofs/FeQ.lean — `FeQ`: the transpiled Rust code as a LITERAL mathlib
   `Field` instance (and a ring isomorphism `FeQ ≃+* 𝔽_p`).

   CONTEXT.  The Rust crate curve25519/solana-ed25519 implements 𝔽_p,
   p = 2²⁵⁵ − 19, on five radix-2⁵¹ u64 limbs (`FieldElement51`); the code was
   transpiled mechanically (Charon + Aeneas) to gen/CurveField/{Types,Funs}.lean.
   Proofs/FieldMain.lean proved THE MAIN THEOREM (`fieldImplementation`): under
   the dalek limb-bound invariant every transpiled operation is TOTAL (panic-
   free) and realizes the corresponding 𝔽_p operation through the denotation
   ⟪·⟫ : Fe → 𝔽_p.

   WHY THIS FILE.  `fieldImplementation` is a *certificate about* the code; the
   field axioms appear there as `impl_*` corollaries, each phrased "the ops run
   and the denotations satisfy the law".  One step remains to make the claim
   "the Rust code IS a field" literally type-check:

       instance : Field FeQ

   where every CORE structure field (add, sub, neg, mul, inv, zero, one) is
   *defined by running the transpiled Rust functions*.  A `Field Fe` instance
   is impossible (see FieldMain.lean's header):
   * the representation is REDUNDANT — one field element has many limb
     vectors, so `mul_comm` etc. are FALSE as equalities of limb vectors;
   * the operations are PARTIAL — they live in the `Result` monad and are
     only guaranteed total on bounded inputs.
   The QUOTIENT fixes both defects at once, and it is the *canonical* fix:

   1. restrict to the valid elements    `VFe := {a : Fe // Bnd a 2⁵²}`
      (totality holds there: every op returns `ok` — FieldMain's runners);
   2. quotient by equality of denotations:  `FeQ := VFe / (⟪·⟫ = ⟪·⟫)`
      (redundancy disappears: a class IS a field element).

   `FeQ` is therefore "the type of field elements as the Rust code represents
   them", with no information added and none removed — and on it the field
   laws hold as REAL equalities, so a genuine `Field FeQ` instance exists.

   HOW THE OPERATIONS ARE DEFINED — `Classical.choose` extraction.  FieldMain's
   runners are existence theorems, e.g.

       run_mul : Bnd a 2⁵⁴ → Bnd b 2⁵⁴ →
                   ∃ r, fe_mul a b = ok r ∧ Bnd r 2⁵² ∧ ⟪r⟫ = ⟪a⟫·⟪b⟫.

   `(run_mul …).choose` names THE result of that run: by the equation
   `fe_mul a b = ok r` the value `r` is uniquely determined — `Result` is
   deterministic, `ok` is injective — so choice does not "pick" anything, it
   merely gives the already-determined machine result a Lean name (the
   functions cannot be executed inside Lean terms directly because they
   return in `Result`; `choose` is the standard bridge from "the run
   succeeds" to "the value of the run").  The accompanying `.choose_spec`
   hands back the program equation (`v*_runs` below — the receipt that the
   definition really is the Rust run) and the denotation fact (`v*_denote`).

   CONTENTS, in order:
     §1  `run_reduce`, `run_add_red` — two more runners: `reduce` is total on
         ANY input and denotation-preserving; `add`-then-`reduce` restores the
         2⁵² bound that bare limbwise `add` (output 2⁵³) does not.
     §2  `VFe`, the setoid (a ≈ b ↔ ⟪a⟫ = ⟪b⟫), and `FeQ` — the carrier.
     §3  `vzero vone vadd vsub vneg vmul vinv` — the operations on `VFe`,
         each extracted from a runner, with `_runs` and `_denote` facts.
     §4  congruences + `Quotient.map/map₂` lifts `qadd … qinv` to `FeQ`.
     §5  THE BRIDGE `denoteQ : FeQ → 𝔽_p` — injective AND surjective — and
         the extensionality principle `feq_ext`.
     §6  every field law for the q-operations (each proof: drop to 𝔽_p via
         `feq_ext`, rewrite with the denotation equations, close with the
         𝔽_p law).
     §7  `instance : CommRing FeQ` and `instance : Field FeQ` — built
         DIRECTLY (layered structure literals; not via Function.Injective.field),
         with the Rust-run operations as the structure fields.
     §8  `feQRingEquiv : FeQ ≃+* 𝔽_p`, `Fintype FeQ` (FeQ is a FINITE field),
         and the axiom audit (`#print axioms` — the three standard axioms).

   AXIOM HYGIENE: `#print axioms feQRingEquiv` reports only
   [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] — no sorry, no native_decide, no
   custom axiom (the 4 axioms modeling externals in
   gen/CurveField/FunsExternal.lean are outside the dependency cone).
   `Classical.choice` enters exactly through the `choose` extraction
   explained above (and through mathlib's `Field 𝔽_p`); `Quot.sound` through
   the quotient.  Nothing in gen/ (the transpiled code) was modified.

   Imports: Proofs/FieldMain.lean (the main theorem and its runners, plus —
   transitively — everything else).  Imported by: nothing; this file is the
   capstone of the development.

/-! ## §1  Two more runners: `reduce`, and `add` followed by `reduce`

`run_add` (FieldMain.lean) outputs `Bnd r 2⁵³` — limbwise addition does not
reduce, so its result is NOT a valid element (`Valid` = `Bnd · 2⁵²`) and
cannot serve as the result of a `VFe`-level addition.  The Rust crate's own
answer is `FieldElement51::reduce` (one carry pass); composing the transpiled
`add` with the transpiled `reduce` yields a bound-restoring, denotation-
correct addition.  Both runners below follow the `run_*` format of
FieldMain.lean: plain existentials `∃ r, code = ok r ∧ Bnd ∧ ⟪·⟫-equation`. -/

/-- `reduce` runs on ANY input and preserves the denotation.

    RUST ANALOG: `FieldElement51::reduce`,
    curve25519/solana-ed25519/src/backend/serial/u64/field.rs:290-323 (one
    parallel carry pass; the top carry re-enters at limb 0 multiplied by 19).

    MATH:  forall a : Fe,  exists r,
           fe_reduce a = ok r,  Bnd(r, 2^52),  ⟪r⟫ = ⟪a⟫.
    LaTeX: $\forall a\ \exists r,\ \mathrm{reduce}(a)=\mathrm{ok}\,r \wedge
           \mathrm{Bnd}(r,2^{52}) \wedge \llbracket r\rrbracket =
           \llbracket a\rrbracket$.

    Note there is NO precondition: `reduce_spec` (ReduceSpec.lean) is total on
    arbitrary u64 limbs.  Its exact ℕ accounting `feVal r + p·(a₄ div 2⁵¹) =
    feVal a` becomes `⟪r⟫ = ⟪a⟫` after one cast to 𝔽_p, because the term
    `p·…` is a multiple of p and vanishes (`ZMod.natCast_self : (p : 𝔽_p) = 0`).
    The output bound 2⁵¹ + 19·2¹³ is weakened to the uniform 2⁵².

    WHY NEEDED: the second half of `run_add_red`; gives `vadd` (§3) a result
    that is again `Valid`. -/
theorem run_reduce (a : Fe) :
    ∃ r, fe_reduce a = ok r ∧ Bnd r (2^52) ∧ ⟪r⟫ = ⟪a⟫ := by
  -- name the limbs (reduce_spec needs them) and run the spec
  obtain ⟨a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, hl⟩ := Fe.exists_limbs a
  obtain ⟨r, hr, hbnd, hval⟩ := spec_exists (reduce_spec a a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 hl)
  refine ⟨r, hr, hbnd.mono (by norm_num), ?_⟩   -- 2^51 + 19·2^13 ≤ 2^52
  -- hval : feVal r + P * (a4.val / 2^51) = feVal a   (exact, over ℕ).
  -- Cast both sides into 𝔽_p; the P-multiple dies (P ≡ 0 mod P).
  have hcast : ((feVal r + P * (a4.val / 2^51) : ℕ) : Fp)
      = ((feVal a : ℕ) : Fp) := by rw [hval]
  simpa [denote, ZMod.natCast_self] using hcast

/-- Valid + Valid → Valid addition: the transpiled `add` CHAINED INTO the
    transpiled `reduce` (at the program level, with the monadic `do`).

    RUST ANALOG: `&a + &b` followed by `(…).reduce()` — exactly what the crate
    itself does whenever a sum must satisfy the limb discipline again (e.g.
    inside `AddAssign`/point formulas); both functions are the transpiled
    originals, composed in the `Result` monad.

    MATH:  Bnd(a,2^52), Bnd(b,2^52)  ==>  exists r,
           (add a b >>= reduce) = ok r,  Bnd(r, 2^52),  ⟪r⟫ = ⟪a⟫ + ⟪b⟫.
    LaTeX: $\llbracket r\rrbracket = \llbracket a\rrbracket +
           \llbracket b\rrbracket$ with $r$ again 2⁵²-bounded.

    WHY NEEDED: this is the program `vadd` (§3) extracts its value from —
    bare `run_add`'s 2⁵³ output bound would leave `VFe` not closed under
    addition. -/
theorem run_add_red {a b : Fe} (ha : Bnd a (2^52)) (hb : Bnd b (2^52)) :

            let s ← fe_add a b
            fe_reduce s) = ok r ∧ Bnd r (2^52) ∧ ⟪r⟫ = ⟪a⟫ + ⟪b⟫ := by
  -- run the limbwise add (result s, Bnd 2^53, ⟪s⟫ = ⟪a⟫+⟪b⟫) …

/-! ## §2  The carrier: valid elements, the setoid, and the quotient `FeQ` -/

/-- A VALID field element: a limb vector together with the proof that it
    satisfies the working invariant `Bnd · 2⁵²` (= `Valid`, FieldMain.lean) —
    the bound every transpiled operation re-establishes and `encode`
    satisfies.

    RUST ANALOG: a `FieldElement51` that respects the crate's documented limb
    discipline (u64/field.rs:26-42) — i.e. every value the Rust API actually
    produces.

    MATH:  VFe = { a : Fe | all limbs of a are < 2^52 }.

    WHY NEEDED: on `VFe` every operation of the API is TOTAL (the runners'
    preconditions hold), so operations extracted from the runners are honest
    functions `VFe → VFe`. -/
def VFe := {a : Fe // Bnd a (2^52)}

/-- Two valid elements are equivalent iff they DENOTE the same element of 𝔽_p.

    MATH:  a ≈ b  iff  ⟪a⟫ = ⟪b⟫  — the kernel of the denotation map.
    Reflexivity/symmetry/transitivity are inherited from `=` on 𝔽_p.

    WHY NEEDED: the limb representation is redundant (e.g. the `mul` carry
    chains produce DIFFERENT limb vectors for `a*b` and `b*a`); identifying
    denotation-equal vectors is exactly what makes the field laws equalities. -/
instance vfeSetoid : Setoid VFe :=
  ⟨fun a b => ⟪a.1⟫ = ⟪b.1⟫,
   fun _ => rfl, fun h => h.symm, fun h₁ h₂ => h₁.trans h₂⟩

/-- Unfolding lemma for the setoid relation (definitionally true).
    WHY NEEDED: lets later proofs move between `a ≈ b` and the denotation
    equation without relying on definitional unfolding inside `rw`. -/
theorem vfe_equiv_iff {a b : VFe} : a ≈ b ↔ ⟪a.1⟫ = ⟪b.1⟫ := Iff.rfl

/-- **The type of field elements, as the Rust code represents them.**

    MATH:  FeQ = VFe / ≈  — bounded limb vectors modulo equal denotation.
    LaTeX: $\mathrm{FeQ} = \{a : \mathrm{Fe} \mid \mathrm{Bnd}(a,2^{52})\}
           /\ (\llbracket\cdot\rrbracket = \llbracket\cdot\rrbracket)$.

    An element of `FeQ` is an equivalence class of valid limb vectors; the
    bridge `denoteQ` (§5) shows `FeQ` is in BIJECTION with 𝔽_p.  On this type
    — and only on this type — "the Rust operations form a field" can be a
    literal `Field` instance (§7).

    WHY NEEDED: the whole point of the file. -/
def FeQ := Quotient vfeSetoid

/-! ## §3  The operations on `VFe`: extracted from the Rust runs

Each definition below is `Classical.choose` of a runner — i.e. *the value the
transpiled Rust function returns on the given inputs* (see the file header:
the run equation `… = ok r` pins the value uniquely; `choose` only names it).
For each operation we record two facts:

  * `v*_runs`   — the program equation `transpiled-code inputs = ok (v* …)`,
                  the RECEIPT that the definition is the Rust run (kept
                  reachable for documentation; the algebra below only needs
                  the denotation);
  * `v*_denote` — the denotation equation, e.g. ⟪vmul a b⟫ = ⟪a⟫·⟪b⟫,
                  which powers every law in §6.

All definitions are `noncomputable` — Lean cannot RUN the extracted machine
code (it lives in the `Result` monad and `choose` is classical) — but they
are definitionally tied to it by the `v*_runs` equations. -/

The denotation ⟪·⟫ : Fe → 𝔽_p is neither injective (redundant limbs) nor
total-friendly (unbounded elements break the ops).  On `FeQ` both defects are
gone: `denoteQ` is INJECTIVE by construction of the quotient and SURJECTIVE
by `encode` (Field.lean) — `FeQ` and 𝔽_p are the same field in different

/-! ## §7  `FeQ` IS a mathlib field — with the Rust runs as structure fields

Built DIRECTLY, in two layers (CommRing, then Field), so that the data
fields are EXACTLY the q-operations of §4 — i.e. the Rust-run operations:

    add = qadd (Rust add+reduce)   mul = qmul (Rust mul)
    neg = qneg (Rust negate)       sub = qsub (Rust sub)
    inv = qinv (Rust invert)       0 = ⟦Rust ZERO⟧   1 = ⟦Rust ONE⟧

The remaining *auxiliary* data (nsmul/zsmul/npow/natCast/intCast, div, zpow,
ℚ-casts) is left to mathlib's canonical defaults — they are DERIVED from the
core ops (e.g. `div a b := a * b⁻¹` runs Rust mul + invert) and carry no
axiomatic content.  `nnqsmul := _`/`qsmul := _` follow the instruction in
mathlib's `DivisionRing` docstring (unification fills `(cast · * ·)`). -/
