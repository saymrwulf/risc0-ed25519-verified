   Proofs/FieldMain.lean — MAIN RESULT: the transpiled `FieldElement51` code
   implements the field 𝔽_p, p = 2²⁵⁵ − 19.

   CONTEXT. The Rust crate curve25519/solana-ed25519 implements F_p on
   5 radix-2^51 u64 limbs (src/field.rs + src/backend/serial/u64/field.rs);
   Charon+Aeneas transpiled it mechanically to gen/CurveField/{Types,Funs}.lean.
   The denotation ⟪a⟫ = (a0 + a1·2^51 + a2·2^102 + a3·2^153 + a4·2^204) mod p
   and the limb-bound invariant `Bnd a c` ("all 5 limbs < c") are defined in
   Proofs/Denote.lean; per-operation specs in Add/SubNeg/Mul/Square/Const/
   Invert-Spec.lean; the Field-Fp instance and surjectivity in Field.lean.

   WHY THIS SHAPE. A literal `Field Fe` instance is mathematically impossible:
   * the representation is REDUNDANT — a field element has many limb
     representations, so e.g. `mul_comm` is FALSE as an equality of limb
     vectors (only the denotations agree);
   * the operations are PARTIAL — machine arithmetic can overflow, so every
     transpiled op returns in the `Result` monad (`ok r` = success, `fail` =
     panic/overflow) and is only guaranteed on bounded inputs.
   So "the transpiled code is a field" is formalized the standard way for
   verified implementations, through the surjective denotation:

     * 𝔽_p (= `ZMod P`) IS a field          — mathlib instance + our
       axiom-free primality certificate for p (Proofs/P25519.lean);
     * the denotation ⟪·⟫ : Fe → 𝔽_p is surjective on bounded elements;
     * every transpiled operation TOTALLY (no panic) realizes the
       corresponding field operation of 𝔽_p through ⟪·⟫, under the
       documented limb-bound invariant (the dalek 2⁵⁴ discipline, which the
       Rust code itself asserts via debug_assert! → `massert`);
     * consequently every field axiom holds for the implementation up to
       denotation — proved below as the `impl_*` corollaries, each of which
       RUNS the actual transpiled functions.

   THIS FILE contains, in order:
     1. `run_*` combinators — one per operation, converting the spec triples
        `x ⦃ post ⦄` into plain existentials `∃ r, x = ok r ∧ Bnd r _ ∧ ⟪r⟫ = _`
        (via `spec_exists`), with bounds normalized to the uniform 2⁵²/2⁵⁴
        discipline;
     2. `IsFieldImplementation` — the certificate Prop bundling surjectivity
        and the eight operation contracts;
     3. `fieldImplementation` — THE MAIN THEOREM: the certificate holds;
     4. the `impl_*` corollaries — every field axiom, at implementation level.

   AXIOM HYGIENE: `#print axioms fieldImplementation` reports only Lean's
   three standard axioms [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] — no sorry,
   no native_decide, no custom axiom (the 4 axioms modeling externals in
   gen/CurveField/FunsExternal.lean are outside the dependency cone).

   Nothing in gen/ (the transpiled code) was modified.

   Imports: InvertSpec.lean (which transitively pulls in every other Proofs/
   file).  Imported by: nothing — this is the root of the development.

/-! ## Runners: totality + facts for each transpiled op

One `run_*` theorem per operation. Each takes the operation's spec triple
(from the *Spec.lean files), passes it through `spec_exists`
(Proofs/Field.lean) to obtain `∃ r, op = ok r ∧ …` — "the machine code
RUNS without panicking and returns r" — and normalizes the output bound
to the uniform validity discipline:

   Valid (= Bnd · 2⁵²)  ──any op──▶  output Bnd ≤ 2⁵²  (add: 2⁵³)

so the results can be chained: any output is again a legal input (after the
trivial weakening 2⁵² ≤ 2⁵⁴, `valid54` below). -/

/-! ## The field-implementation certificate -/

/-- The transpiled curve25519 field code implements the field 𝔽_p through the
    denotation ⟪·⟫ on limb-bounded elements: all operations are total (no
    panics / overflows) on the invariant and realize the field structure.

    This `structure … : Prop` is just a named conjunction of nine claims —
    a CERTIFICATE. Field by field:
    * `surj`    — ⟪·⟫ hits all of 𝔽_p with bounded representatives, so the
                  remaining clauses speak about every field element, not just
                  the reachable ones;
    * `zero_ok`/`one_ok` — the constants evaluate (they are `Result`s too:
                  Rust consts become monadic thunks under Aeneas) to bounded
                  elements denoting 0 and 1;
    * `add_ok`/`sub_ok`/`neg_ok`/`mul_ok`/`inv_ok` — on bounded inputs the
                  op returns `ok r` (NO PANIC — every machine-arithmetic
                  side condition holds) with `r` again bounded and
                  ⟪r⟫ = the corresponding 𝔽_p operation on the inputs.
    Together with `Field Fp` (mathlib, P prime) this is the standard meaning
    of "this code implements 𝔽_p": a literal `Field Fe` instance cannot
    exist (redundant representation, partial ops — see the file header), so
    the field laws transfer through ⟪·⟫ instead — see the `impl_*`
    corollaries below, which derive each axiom in executable form.
    WHY NEEDED: this is the STATEMENT of the main theorem. -/

    discharged by the corresponding `run_*` runner above (which in turn
    packages the per-operation machine-code proofs of the *Spec.lean files),
    and surjectivity by `denote_surjective` (Proofs/Field.lean).

/-! ## The field axioms, at the implementation level

Each `impl_*` theorem runs the actual transpiled operations and states the
corresponding field law up to denotation. They are direct consequences of
the `run_*` specs + the field structure of 𝔽_p. Throughout, `Valid a` means
`Bnd a (2^52)` (the bound every operation re-establishes).

Note the shape: a law like commutativity CANNOT be `fe_mul a b = fe_mul b a`
(the limb vectors generally differ!), nor can it ignore totality. So each
law asserts (1) all the involved operation calls return `ok` — the code
actually runs — and (2) the final denotations agree. Covered axioms:
  impl_zero_ne_one, impl_add_comm, impl_add_assoc, impl_zero_add,
  impl_add_neg, impl_mul_comm, impl_mul_assoc, impl_one_mul,
  impl_mul_inv_cancel, impl_left_distrib
— exactly the `Field` axioms of mathlib (right-distributivity and `mul_one`
etc. follow from commutativity, included here via impl_mul_comm). -/

/- The working invariant: a "valid" field element has all limbs < 2^52 —
   the bound every operation's output satisfies (add: 2^53, see add_ok) and
   `encode` satisfies, so valid elements are closed under the API.
   WHY NEEDED: gives the impl_* laws a single, chainable precondition. -/

    chain code, `r` by the real multiplication code, and Fermat guarantees
    the product denotes 1.  (For ⟪a⟫ = 0 inversion still RUNS and returns
    the 0 element — see `inv_ok` — but of course no r with ⟪r⟫ = 1 exists.) -/

    (Right distributivity follows with `impl_mul_comm`.)  The inner sum
    b+c is only Bnd 2⁵³ — still a legal mul input after weakening to 2⁵⁴,
