   Proofs/DecompressSpec.lean — phase 2, the constructive decompress chain,
   part 1: the arithmetic ingredients of `sqrt_ratio_i`.

   · `pow_p58_spec`     — a^((p−5)/8) via the pow22501 chain (Fermat-style,
                          the invert_spec pattern with exponent 2²⁵² − 3);
   · √−1               — already certified (ConstSpecs.sqrt_m1_spec);
   · `fe_ct_eq_spec`    — the constant-time field comparison decides
                          denotational equality: to_bytes is CANONICAL
                          (to_bytes_spec), so byte equality is residue
                          equality in both directions.

   Part 2 (sequel): the sqrt_ratio_i success-case walk, from_bytes, and
   `decompress_of_canonical` — the constructive upgrade of the point-level
   verification equation.
