   Proofs/ScalarReduceSpec.lean — Scalar52 Montgomery reduction, the main walk.

   Rounds 0–4 of `montgomery_reduce` (the five exact-division `part1` rounds),
   composed with `mont_tail_spec` (rounds 5–8 + the `sub _ L`
   canonicalization) from ScalarMontSpec. Split across two files because the
   74-step monolith exceeds a single declaration's elaboration budget
   (METHOD 4); each half is a `mul_internal`-sized walk.

/-- The nonce value N = Σ n_k·2^52k of five 52-bit digits stays below R.
    Standalone so its `omega` sees exactly five hypotheses — inside the
    walk, the same goal drags ~110 hypotheses (five round equations with
    2^102-scale coefficients included) into one Presburger instance and
    never returns (measured: the single spiralling line of the file). -/

/-- **Montgomery reduction is exact division by R = 2^260 mod ℓ.** For a
    9-limb double-width input Z = Σ z_k·2^52k with column-bounded limbs
    (z_k < 2^107, what `mul_internal` produces) and the standard
    Montgomery hypothesis Z < 2^260·ℓ, the transpiled `montgomery_reduce`
    returns a 52-bit-bounded scalar r with  ⟦r⟧·2^260 = Z  in ZMod ℓ.
    Rounds 0–4 walk `part1_spec` here; rounds 5–8 and the `sub _ L`
    canonicalization are `mont_tail_spec`; the value accounting is
    `mont_head_telescope` + `mont_bound`. -/
