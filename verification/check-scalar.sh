# check-scalar.sh — THE SECOND BUTTON (Scalar52 arithmetic mod ℓ).
#
# Runs against the merged gen/CurveField universe (the scalar module lives
# there since the merge; see extract.sh). Guarded compiles throughout.
#
# Brought to the same standard as check.sh on 2026-07-30 (P0-b). Before that
# it was the weakest link in the estate, and increasingly so as the main button
# was hardened: no source-integrity check, no harness pin, no dead-file gate,
# no declaration inventory, an EVADABLE source-text grep for axioms where the
# main button asks the kernel, and a count of matching output lines where the
# main button asserts each certificate's cone individually.
#
# Phases:
#   0  source integrity + harness pin (so running this button alone is also
#      protected, not only running it after check.sh)
#   1  the two-button seam: every shipped proof source belongs to exactly one
#      of the two manifests, asserted against check.sh's, both directions
#   2  compile the scalar layer, with a dead-file gate over Scalar*
#  2b  kernel-side axiom-declaration gate over the compiled artifacts
#  2c  environment-derived declaration inventory, diffed both directions
#   3  per-certificate exact-cone audit

# ── Phase 3c: statement + specification binding ─────────────────────────────
# WHAT PHASE 3 DOES NOT ESTABLISH — and why this repository claimed something
# false for four rounds. Round-7 review (GPT-5.6, register key
# `scalar-statements-unbound`, CRITICAL): the main button bound its 31
# certificates' elaborated statements and reachable specification bodies; this
# button bound NONE of its thirteen. Meanwhile TRUSTED-BASE item 8 said the
# audit covers "every certificate" and each README said check.sh audits every
# certificate. Both were false across the 44-certificate repository surface.
#
# The finding was raised in round 7, was lost from the round-8 work list by an
# F-number collision between two reviewers, and was re-raised in round 8. It is
# closed here.
#
# Phase 3 proves each scalar certificate rests on exactly the standard three
# axioms. It does not say WHAT THE THEOREM SAYS. A certificate gutted to a
# tautology of the same cone passes it, and so does one whose reference
# definition has been redefined to BE the extracted code — at which point the
# theorem reads `loop = loop` and the cone is byte-identical.
#
# Proofs/ScalarAudit.lean emits a canonical block holding the policy constants,
# every scalar certificate's fully-elaborated statement (`pp.all`, so implicit
# arguments, instances and universes are all visible), and the body of every
# specification constant transitively reachable from those statements. This
# phase binds its SHA-256, and the block's INPUT is committed too, so a
# mismatch can be DIFFED rather than merely reported.
#
# To rotate deliberately: run this button, take the printed OBSERVED digest,
# and update the constant below AND SCALAR-AUDIT-MANIFEST.txt in the same
# reviewable commit. An author who edits a statement and refreshes the digest
# together is caught by reading the diff, not by this script.
