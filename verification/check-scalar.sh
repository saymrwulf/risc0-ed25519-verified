# check-scalar.sh — THE SECOND BUTTON (Scalar52 arithmetic mod ℓ).
#
# Runs against the merged gen/CurveField universe (the scalar module lives
# there since the merge; see extract.sh). Guarded compiles throughout.
#
# Brought to the same standard as check.sh on 2026-07-30 (P0-b). Before that
# it was the weakest link in the estate, and increasingly so as the main button
# was hardened: no source-integrity check, no harness pin, no dead-file gate,
# no declaration inventory, an EVADABLE source-text grep for axioms where the
# main button asks the kernel, and a count of matching output lines where the
# main button asserts each certificate's cone individually.
#
# Phases:
#   0  source integrity + harness pin (so running this button alone is also
#      protected, not only running it after check.sh)
#   1  the two-button seam: every shipped proof source belongs to exactly one
#      of the two manifests, asserted against check.sh's, both directions
#   2  compile the scalar layer, with a dead-file gate over Scalar*
#  2b  kernel-side axiom-declaration gate over the compiled artifacts
#  2c  environment-derived declaration inventory, diffed both directions
#   3  per-certificate exact-cone audit
