# check.sh — THE button. Compiles EVERY shipped .lean file and axiom-audits
# EVERY layer certificate. If a file is in this repo, this script checks it;
# if this script doesn't check it, it must not be in the repo.
#
# Phases:
#   0. resource + source-integrity guards
#   1. stub audit: no `by trivial` specs, no True-target theorems, and — the
#      anti-axiom-smuggling gate — ZERO `axiom` declarations under Proofs/
#      (external models in gen/ are the only sanctioned axiom site)
#   2. compile gen/ + Proofs/ in dependency order (explicit -o, capped cores,
#      per-file timeout). Any "declaration uses 'sorry'" warning is a FAILURE
#      (this catches sorry robustly — text greps can't, comments mention it).
#  2b. kernel-side axiom-declaration gate: read every compiled Proofs/*.olean
#      and reject ANY axiom declared there. Phase 1's grep reads source text
#      and is evadable four ways (see the phase header); this one asks the
#      kernel, derives its scope from the filesystem, and fails closed if the
#      set of compiled modules does not match the set of shipped sources.
#   3. axiom audit: #print axioms for every certificate in CERTS; each must
#      report exactly [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
#  3b. signature-apex audit: the four apex certificates against this fork's
#      documented SHA-512 + wire-format boundary, exactly.
#  3c. statement + specification binding: Proofs/Audit.lean emits a canonical
#      block of the policy constants, every certificate's fully-elaborated
#      statement, and the body of every specification constant reachable from
#      those statements. Its SHA-256 is pinned here and the block itself is
#      committed, so a mismatch is diffable. This is the phase that makes a
#      gutted statement, or a reference definition redefined to BE the
#      extracted code, fail — neither moves any axiom cone.

# ── Phase 2b: kernel-side axiom-declaration gate ────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Phase 1's anti-smuggling check reads SOURCE TEXT, and a
# source-text grep is the wrong instrument. Measured on Lean v4.30.0-rc2
# (2026-07-28), each of the following compiles cleanly and slips past it:
#     ` axiom cheat : ...`        (one leading space — the pattern is anchored)
#     `@[simp] axiom cheat : ...` (line starts with the attribute)
#     `unsafe axiom cheat : ...`  (`unsafe` is not in the modifier alternation)
#     `axiom` <newline> `  cheat` (no space follows the keyword)
# Only the tab variant is blocked, and by Lean itself, not by us. Hardening the
# pattern would fix the exhibited syntax rather than the class; the class fix is
# to stop parsing text and ask the kernel, which is what this phase does.
# Ported from fips205-slhdsa-verified/verification/Proofs/Audit.lean.
#
# Phase 1's grep is kept as a fast, readable first line of defence. THIS is the
# gate that is load-bearing.
echo "=== Phase 2b: kernel-side axiom-declaration gate ==="

#   · Proofs.Basic and Proofs.ConstSpecs deliberately reuse the name
#     `zero_spec` (they are never imported together), so a whole-corpus import
#     is impossible by construction — it fails with "environment already

# Proofs/Audit.lean emits a canonical block holding the policy constants,
# every certificate's fully-elaborated statement, and the body of every
# specification constant transitively reachable from those statements. This
# phase binds the SHA-256 of that block, and the block's INPUT is committed
# too, so a mismatch can be DIFFED rather than merely reported.
#
# To rotate deliberately: run check.sh, take the printed OBSERVED digest, and
# update the constant below AND AUDIT-MANIFEST.txt in the same reviewable
# commit. That the rotation is visible in review is the whole point — an
# author who edits a statement and refreshes the digest in one commit is
# caught by reading the diff, not by this script.
