# check.sh — THE button. Compiles EVERY shipped .lean file and axiom-audits
# EVERY layer certificate. If a file is in this repo, this script checks it;
# if this script doesn't check it, it must not be in the repo.
#
# Phases:
#   0. resource + source-integrity guards
#   1. stub audit: no `by trivial` specs, no True-target theorems, and — the
#      anti-axiom-smuggling gate — ZERO `axiom` declarations under Proofs/
#      (external models in gen/ are the only sanctioned axiom site)
#   2. compile gen/ + Proofs/ in dependency order (explicit -o, capped cores,
#      per-file timeout). Any "declaration uses 'sorry'" warning is a FAILURE
#      (this catches sorry robustly — text greps can't, comments mention it).
#  2b. kernel-side axiom-declaration gate: read every compiled Proofs/*.olean
#      and reject ANY axiom declared there. Phase 1's grep reads source text
#      and is evadable four ways (see the phase header); this one asks the
#      kernel, derives its scope from the filesystem, and fails closed if the
#      set of compiled modules does not match the set of shipped sources.
#   3. axiom audit: #print axioms for every certificate in CERTS; each must
#      report exactly [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
#  3b. signature-apex audit: the four apex certificates against this fork's
#      documented SHA-512 + wire-format boundary, exactly.
#  3c. statement + specification binding: Proofs/Audit.lean emits a canonical
#      block of the policy constants, every certificate's fully-elaborated
#      statement, and the body of every specification constant reachable from
#      those statements. Its SHA-256 is pinned here and the block itself is
#      committed, so a mismatch is diffable. This is the phase that makes a
#      gutted statement, or a reference definition redefined to BE the
#      extracted code, fail — neither moves any axiom cone.

# --audit-only runs every gate EXCEPT the compile, against the .olean files a

#     worse than no shortcut at all, because a green button would then

#   · the basis file is build state, never committed, so a fresh clone cannot
#     inherit permission to skip compiling;
#   · the final banner DIFFERS, and says in words that the run is not evidence.
#     A transcript must never be mistakable for a full one.

# ── Phase 0d: template/model correspondence ─────────────────────────────────
# WHAT AENEAS'S TEMPLATE IS. When Aeneas extracts the Rust it also emits, for
# each crate, a *_Template.lean naming everything the extracted code needs from
# OUTSIDE itself. That template is the extraction's own statement of its
# boundary. The hand-written *External.lean beside it is our answer to that
# statement, and `extract.sh` has always said, in prose, "after regenerating,
# diff the template against the hand-written file". Prose is not a gate.
#
# WHAT THIS ADDS, given that three other things already stand here. Phase 0b
# byte-pins both files, so neither can drift from its pin unnoticed. The
# generated Funs.lean imports the model and CALLS these externals, so the Lean
# compiler already enforces their types wherever the extracted code uses them.
# The per-certificate exact cones catch any external that becomes — or stops
# being — an assumption anything depends on. What none of those three sees is
# the CLASSIFICATION: for each name the extraction asks for, whether this
# repository answers with an assumption or with a proof.
#
# That distinction is the tier-A/B claim, and it was prose until 2026-07-31.
# The docs say the curve calls (compress, as_bytes,
# vartime_double_scalar_mul_basepoint, from_bytes_mod_order{,_wide}) and the
# three curve TYPES resolve to the PROVEN model's own definitions rather than
# to axioms — because gen/CurveField/Funs.lean opens `namespace
# curve25519_dalek`, so the names Aeneas asks for are the names it defines.
# Nothing checked it. A regeneration that renamed one of those, or a model that
# quietly answered one with an axiom instead, would have left the documents
# claiming a proof where the repository now had an assumption.
#
# model-correspondence.py recomputes the classification from the files —
# namespace-aware, so a definition inside `namespace curve25519_dalek` counts
# under its full name — and the result must equal the committed table exactly.

# ── Phase 2b: kernel-side axiom-declaration gate ────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Phase 1's anti-smuggling check reads SOURCE TEXT, and a
# source-text grep is the wrong instrument. Measured on Lean v4.30.0-rc2
# (2026-07-28), each of the following compiles cleanly and slips past it:
#     ` axiom cheat : ...`        (one leading space — the pattern is anchored)
#     `@[simp] axiom cheat : ...` (line starts with the attribute)
#     `unsafe axiom cheat : ...`  (`unsafe` is not in the modifier alternation)
#     `axiom` <newline> `  cheat` (no space follows the keyword)
# Only the tab variant is blocked, and by Lean itself, not by us. Hardening the
# pattern would fix the exhibited syntax rather than the class; the class fix is
# to stop parsing text and ask the kernel, which is what this phase does.
# Ported from fips205-slhdsa-verified/verification/Proofs/Audit.lean.
#
# Phase 1's grep is kept as a fast, readable first line of defence. THIS is the
# gate that is load-bearing.
echo "=== Phase 2b: kernel-side axiom-declaration gate ==="
# dot-prefixed and inside $HERE: `lean` refuses a file outside the root
# directory, and a leading dot keeps it out of every *.lean glob.
# The gate reads the COMPILED ARTIFACTS directly (readModuleData) rather than
# importing the modules. Two reasons, both load-bearing:
#   · Proofs.Basic and Proofs.ConstSpecs deliberately reuse the name
#     `zero_spec` (they are never imported together), so a whole-corpus import
#     is impossible by construction — it fails with "environment already
#     contains". Reading oleans merges nothing, so collisions cannot arise.
#   · Membership is then SELF-DERIVING from the filesystem: every .olean under
#     Proofs/ is scanned, including Scalar* and AxiomCheck, which the CERTS
#     audit and the dead-file gate both skip. Nothing is on a hand-kept list.
# Cost is ~3 s for the whole corpus (no mathlib import), against ~53 s for a

# ── Phase 2c-accounting: every kernel constant is accounted for ─────────────
# SEPARATED FROM PHASE 2c DELIBERATELY, and the reason is a self-test that
# could not pass (round-7 finding F5). This block reads $KERNLOG, created one
# phase earlier in Phase 2b. selftest-shapes.sh lifts "Phase 2c" by text marker
# and runs it standalone; once this block lived inside that range, the lifted
# driver died on its first `$KERNLOG` expansion under `set -u`. The test failed
# loudly in all four forks from the moment the block was added — so the shapes
# property went unverified, though it never produced a false green.
#
# Truncating the lift is NOT the fix: Phase 2c's own verdict
# (`INVENTORY COVERAGE FAILED`) sits after this block, so a shorter range drops
# the phase's ability to fail at all. Instead the block gets its own marker and
# its own verdict, which makes Phase 2c liftable BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by
# the self-test knowing where to stop.
# ── THE ACCOUNTING IDENTITY ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every declaration the kernel saw must be accounted for by exactly one walk:
# the corpus inventory, or the instruments' own surface. Until 2026-07-31 the
# two numbers were never compared — the kernel reported 3058 across this
# button's manifest, the inventory accounted for 3022, and the 36-declaration
# difference was the audit drivers' own machinery, covered by no allowlist row
# and by no other check. It was not a soundness hole (the drivers ARE in the
# manifest, so Phase 2b's kernel gate rejects an axiom in one whatever its
# indentation) but it was an unexamined remainder, and an unexamined remainder
# is where the next defect hides.
#
# Stating it as an IDENTITY rather than as two separate counts is what makes it
# fail closed: a declaration that slipped out of both walks leaves the sum
# short, and one counted twice leaves it long.
#
# COUNT DISTINCT CONSTANTS, NOT PHYSICAL DECLARATIONS. The two sides of this
# identity were, at first, counting different things, and the gap was papered
# over with a `+ N_DRIVERS` term justified as a "self-observation blind spot".
# That explanation was WRONG. It fitted dalek and anza (2 drivers, residual 2)
# and broke on risc0 and betrusted (1 driver, residual 2) — the residual is 2
# everywhere and has nothing to do with drivers.
#
# The measured cause: Lean materialises equation lemmas LAZILY, when something
# forces an unfold, and each module that forces one gets its own copy in its
# object file. On every fork, `CurveFieldProofs.denote.eq_1` sits in both
# `SubNegSpec.olean` and `ConstSpecs.olean`, and `CurveFieldProofs.limbsVal.eq_1`
# in both `ReduceSpec.olean` and `ConstSpecs.olean`. The kernel gate reads each
# object file separately and counts both copies; the environment holds one
# constant per name and the inventory sees it once. Hence exactly 2.
#
# So the gate now reports DISTINCT names and the fudge term is gone. This still
# fails closed: a declaration missing from both walks leaves the sum short, and
# one counted twice leaves it long. A future mismatch must be explained — as
# this one finally was — never absorbed into a constant.
# PIN THE INSTRUMENTS' OWN SURFACE, in both directions, with the SAME gate the
# corpus uses (round-8 review, Claude, register keys `drv-surface-no-cones`,
# `accounting-certifies-enumeration`, and it retires `drv-naming-heuristic` as
# load-bearing).
#
# The accounting identity below proves every kernel constant is ENUMERATED by
# one of the two walks. The reviewer demonstrated that enumeration is not
# audit: their planted claim WAS enumerated, carried a real axiom cone, and
# nothing examined it — DRV rows had no cone and no allowlist covered them.
# They now carry the cone, and this gate pins them exactly as the corpus is, so
# a claim smuggled into an instrument is a NEW ROW and a new row fails closed
# whatever it is called.

# ── Phase 2d: SEMANTIC model/template correspondence ────────────────────────
# Phase 0d asks a text scanner what the extraction's boundary looks like. This
# phase asks LEAN what it actually is, and requires the two to agree.
#
# WHY BOTH. Round-7 review (GPT-5.6, finding F1) showed the textual classifier
# could be made to report PROVEN for a name Lean resolves to an axiom — a
# definition inside a `/- -/` comment was read as real. Worse, and found while
# repairing that: Aeneas wraps long declarations, and the old scanner required
# keyword and name on one physical line, so it SILENTLY DROPPED them. Nine to
# ten externals per fork had no row at all, and one — the tier-A/B `neg` — was
# missing from every committed table while the docs claimed that class was
# machine-checked.
#
# A source scanner cannot decide this question. Whether a name resolves to an
# assumption or to a proof is a property of the elaborated ENVIRONMENT: it turns
# on imports, namespaces, `export`, aliases and shadowing, none of which are
# visible to a regex. So the scanner's job is now only DISCOVERY — what does the
# template ask for — and even that fails closed. The verdict comes from Lean.
#
# The template itself is deliberately not imported: it declares the same names
# as the hand-written model and the two would clash. Discovery is therefore
# unavoidably textual, which is exactly why `model-correspondence.py` must stop
# rather than skip on anything it cannot parse.

# ── Phase 3c: statement + specification binding ─────────────────────────────
# WHAT THE EARLIER PHASES DO NOT ESTABLISH. Phase 3 proves each certificate
# rests on exactly the declared axioms; 3b does the same for the apex tier.
# Neither says WHAT THE THEOREM SAYS. A certificate gutted to a tautology of
# the same cone passes both. So does one whose reference definition has been
# redefined to BE the extracted code, at which point the theorem reads
# `loop = loop` and every cone is byte-identical.
#
# Proofs/Audit.lean emits a canonical block holding the policy constants,
# every certificate's fully-elaborated statement, and the body of every
# specification constant transitively reachable from those statements. This
# phase binds the SHA-256 of that block, and the block's INPUT is committed
# too, so a mismatch can be DIFFED rather than merely reported.
#
# To rotate deliberately: run check.sh, take the printed OBSERVED digest, and
# update the constant below AND AUDIT-MANIFEST.txt in the same reviewable
# commit. That the rotation is visible in review is the whole point — an
# author who edits a statement and refreshes the digest in one commit is
# caught by reading the diff, not by this script.
